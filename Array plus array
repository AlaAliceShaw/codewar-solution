I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays...actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.
P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.

solution:

function arrayPlusArray(arr1, arr2) {
  arr1 = arr1.reduce((a,b) => a + b, 0);
  arr2 = arr2.reduce((a,b) => a + b, 0);
  return arr1 + arr2; 
}

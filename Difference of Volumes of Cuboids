In this simple exercise, you will create a program that will take two lists of integers, a and b.
Each list will consist of 3 positive integers above 0, representing the dimensions of cuboids a and b. 
You must find the difference of the cuboids' volumes regardless of which is bigger.
For example, if the parameters passed are ([2, 2, 3], [5, 4, 1]), the volume of a is 12 and the volume of b is 20. 
Therefore, the function should return 8.
Your function will be tested with pre-made examples as well as random ones.
If you can, try writing it in one line of code.



solution 1 ;

function findDifference(a, b) {
  let v1 = a[0] * a[1] * a[2];
  let v2 = b[0] * b[1] * b[2];
    if(v1 > v2) return v1 - v2;
  else 
    return v2 - v1;
}


solution 2 ;

function find_difference(a, b) {
  return Math.abs(a[0]*a[1]*a[2]-b[0]*b[1]*b[2]);
}

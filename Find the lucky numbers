Write a function filterLucky/filter_lucky() that accepts a list of integers and filters the list to only
include the elements that contain the digit 7.
For example,
ghci> filterLucky [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,68,69,70,15,17]
[7,70,17]

solution:

var filterLucky=x=>{
  x = x.filter(el => String(el).includes ("7"));
  return x;
}

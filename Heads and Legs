#Task

Assuming there are no other types of animals, work out how many of each animal are there.
Return a tuple in Python - (chickens, cows) and an array list - [chickens, cows]/{chickens, cows} in all other languages
If either the heads & legs is negative, the result of your calculation is negative or the calculation is a float return "No solutions" 
(no valid cases).
In the form:
[Heads, Legs] = [72, 200]
VALID - [72, 200] =>             [44 , 28]   
                             [Chickens, Cows]
INVALID - [72, 201] => "No solutions"
However, if 0 heads and 0 legs are given always return [0, 0] since zero heads must give zero animals.
There are many different ways to solve this, but they all give the same answer.
You will only be given integers types - however negative values (edge cases) will be given.


solution:

function animals(heads, legs){
  let cow = (legs - heads * 2) / 2;
  let chicken = heads - (legs - heads * 2) / 2;
  if (chicken < 0 || cow < 0 || Math.round(chicken) !== chicken || Math.round(cow) !== cow){
    return "No solutions";
  } else if(heads === 0 || legs === 0){
    return [0, 0];
  }else{
    return [chicken, cow];
  }
}

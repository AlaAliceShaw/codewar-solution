Task
King Arthur and his knights are having a New Years party. Last year Lancelot was jealous of Arthur, 
because Arthur had a date and Lancelot did not, and they started a duel.
To prevent this from happening again, Arthur wants to make sure that there are at least as many women as men at this year's party.
He gave you a list of integers of all the party goers.
Arthur needs you to return true if he needs to invite more women or false if he is all set.

function inviteMoreWomen(L) {
  let male = 0;
  let female = 0;
    for(let i = 0; i < L.length; i++){
      if(L[i] == 1){
      male++;
      } else {
      female++
      }
    }
  return male > female;
}
